penguin-dart
============

A Dart based version of the Penguin app used to try out some concepts using Dart.

The has a simple model of Queues that contain lists of Stories. 
The UI allows basic CRUD operations to be performed against the model.

Issues/TODO: 
The round-trip JSON<->Model requires some helper methods in the model. 
It would be nice if these could be eliminated, or replaced with annotations.
